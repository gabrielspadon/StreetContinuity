StreetContinuity (SC)
--------------

    StreetContinuity (SC) is a python library that implements both Intersection Continuity Negotiation (ICN) and
    Hierarchical Intersection Continuity Negotiation (HICN). ICN was first proposed by Porta et al. (2006) and
    further enhanced by Masucci et al. (2014), who advanced with the HICN approach.

    For details about each implementation, please refer to:

        Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 369, Issue 2, 2006, Pages 853-866, ISSN 0378-4371.

Acknowledgement

    I want to thank Elisabeth H. Krueger and Xianyuan Zhan, who provide me with their version of the HICN.
    Their code gave some insights and helped in the process of validation of the results.

Dependencies
--------------

    * numpy (1.15.4)
    * osmnx (0.8.1)
    * networkx (2.1)

Example
--------------

    >>> import osmnx as ox
    >>> from street_continuity.all import *

    >>> oxg = ox.graph_from_point((-22.012282, -47.890821), distance=5000)

    >>> # use_label = True: uses HICN algorithm
    >>> # use_label = False: uses ICN algorithm

    >>> p_graph = from_osmnx(oxg=oxg, use_label=True)
    >>> d_graph = dual_mapper(primal_graph=p_graph, min_angle=120)

    >>> # you must create the data directory before running this command
    >>> write_graphml(graph=d_graph, filename='file.graphml', directory='data')
    >>> write_supplementary(graph=d_graph, filename='supplementary.txt', directory='data')
